# Raw output

This folder contains the raw output of each experiment performed for the paper. Additionally, it contains a script that was used to generate the experiment design table (which contains the order in which each subject was ran).


## How to run

`python3 create_1f_mt_table.py excluded_subjects.txt kebab_run*`

Excluded subjects are excluded because one of the Lacuna analyzers gave errors while running on these subjects.
